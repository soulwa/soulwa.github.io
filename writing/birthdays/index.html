      <h1 class="title"> birthdays </h1>
      <p class="subtitle"><strong></strong></p>
      <p>Today used to mean something. The whole week, a who's who of<br>
      birthdays. It's all faded away now. Spending time in class tied up in<br>
      knots. Now I have a headache. Too little food or caffeine or both. For<br>
      years after I wouldn't text anyone happy birthday but I'd give it a little<br>
      acknowledgement. Now it's like a silhouette. I had to squint to<br>
      see it. Or when you leave something at home, just a small itch like that.<br>
      I used to give myself a lot of trouble over birthdays. Getting a gift for<br>
      birthdays. A desperate expression for how I felt. A penance, really.<br>
      Nowadays I can't remember birthdays all that well. I guess there's less<br>
      people to know. And I'm even worse about the gifts, I just don't get them.<br>
      But it's better than it was before.<p>
