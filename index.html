      <p> hi, i'm <strong>sam</strong>. </p> 
      <p> i studied computer science &amp; mathematics at Northeastern University and i'm now pursuing a Masters in computer science. </p>
      <p> my main interests in this area are <strong>graphics</strong>, <strong>game development</strong>, and <strong>compilers</strong> (especially: type theory and memory safety)</p>
      <p> outside of this, i'm interested in game design, reading/writing creatively, Critical Theory, and music, esp. local to boston </p>
      <p>i'll be hacking on this site quite a bit in coming weeks - keep an eye out :-)</p>

      <h3> work </h3>
      <ul>
          <li> currently, i work at an early-stage startup as a lead engineer while pursuing my Masters </li>
          <li> previously, i worked as a software engineering intern at <a href="https://starry.com/">Starry</a> and <a href="https://warnerbrosgames.com/">Warner Bros Games</a>. </li>
          <li> i was also a TA for Northeastern's <strong>accelerated</strong> fundamentals of computer science course </li>
      </ul>

      <h3> games </h3>
      <ul>
          <li>i helped with most aspects of <a href="https://xenozane.itch.io/darwinism">darwinism</a> for the gmtk 2024 game jam</li>
          <li>i helped design and playtest <a href="https://dizzywizards.com/">Dizzy Wizards</a>, a tabletop game you can print and play for free!</li>
          <li>i made <a href="https://github.com/soulwa/soulful">soulful</a> back during COVID's quarantine- only code is available. the idea for this game was having a rhythm game where the way you made and played beatmaps was the same.</li>
          <li>i made <a href="https://soulware.itch.io/super-no-touchy-flooro">"<strong>super</strong> no touchy flooro"</a> in high school, based off a game i made (and named...) as a kid - a platformer with 40+ levels (not all of which are fair..)</li>
