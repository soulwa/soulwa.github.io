I love playing and making games; my itch.io and Github have some of my works. I also love speedrunning, but I'm more of a spectator myself.
I do have [one run](https://www.speedrun.com/tf/run/m79g905y) on [speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/), and hold the tied world record for fastest completion of [DUET](https://www.duetgame.com/) on iOS.

I listen to some music. My last.fm is [here](https://www.last.fm/user/soulware_). Some of my favorite artists right now are black midi, Playboi Carti, Vince Staples, Squid, Death Grips, BROCKHAMPTON, Cartier'God, and Bladee.
